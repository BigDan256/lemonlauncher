Lemon Launcher is a simple mame front-end intended for use inside
an arcade machine.

Requirements
============

Lemon Launcher should work with most platforms that support SDL.
I've tested Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.  These are the dependancies:

* SDL
* SDL_image (with at least PNG support)
* SDL_ttf
* SDL_gfx
* libConfuse
