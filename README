Lemon Launcher is a simple mame front-end intended for use inside an arcade
machine.  Game selection is meant to be as easy as possible using only a
joystick and buttons.


Requirements
============

Lemon Launcher should work with most platforms that support SDL.
I've tested Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.  These are the dependancies:

* SDL
* SDL_image (with at least PNG support)
* SDL_ttf
* SDL_gfx
* libConfuse


Installation
============

Install the dependancies.  Extract the tar.gz file and run:
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

By default lemon launcher will search for configuration files in your home
directory (~/.lemonlauncher/).  Sample configuration files can be found here:
/usr/share/lemonlauncher/lemonlauncher.conf
/usr/share/lemonlauncher/games.conf

You can override the default configuration file search path by passing a static
directory path to the configure script (--with-confdir).


Customizing
===========

Lemon launcher uses a set of default options which work well in most cases.
However, lemon launcher is extensively customizable.  Copy the example
lemonlauncher.conf file (/usr/share/lemonlauncher/lemonlauncher.conf) to your
config directory (~/.lemonlauncher/lemonlauncher.conf) and edit with your
favorite text editor.

Default key mapping is based on the factory keycodes on the ultimarc ipac and
jpac.  See the key mapping section of lemonlauncher.conf for a list of keys and
their function.  Note this file uses raw SDL key codes.  For a comprehensive
list of key names and their codes see:
/usr/share/lemonlauncher/keycodes.txt

Default font in lemon launcher is Bitstream Vera Sans Bold.  You can override
this default at compile time using the --with-default-font switch to the
configure script.  You can also set the current font in the lemonlauncher.conf.
