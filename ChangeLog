 Nov 04/2007
=======================
+ removed "params" option (not needed, see below)
+ renamed "path" option to "mame"
+ renamed "snaps" option to "snap"
+ "mame" and "snap" path options must contain the '%r' specifier which will
  be replaced with the short rom name.  this removes the need for the params
  option since the "mame" path can contain command line switches.

+ enabled key repeat (default delay/interval)
+ removed delayed event queue resuming after mame exits
