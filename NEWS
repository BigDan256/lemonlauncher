===========================================
This is the first working commit of the lemon launcher re-write.  It is a
work in progress which means there is probably bugs and not all features
are complete yet.

ToDo list:
 * use config file path in config.h (if set)
 * update Makefile.am files to support "make install"
 * implement screen capture feature
