===========================================
Version 0.0.5 should be ready to release now.  It has a number of important
features and updates:

 * simple skinning system
 * key-repeat (hold down key to scroll through list)
 * fixed "keys dont work" bug after game exits
 * dissabled mouse cursor
 * merged "path" and "params" option in to "mame" option which should
   contain the mame path plus and required parameters along with %r
   format specifier where the rom name should be substituted
 * "snap" option also uses %r for rom name substitution which yields
   better control over path and image type

There's always a ToDo list:
 * still would like to work on the menu system, either create a tool for
   generating the menus or add automatic menu generating

===========================================
The configuration file and the games list are completely optional now.
They are still required in order for the program to be useful but it's
no longer an error if they are missing.  An empty games list is used
if games.conf is not found and default options are used if
lemonlauncher.conf is not found.

If default options are used, the launcher will load font from the
default font set at compile time set by the configure script.  This
font file can be customized by setting the with-default-font switch.
Due to the license of the slicker.ttf font (the original font used
in lemon launcher) this file can not be packaged with the source.
Instead, VeraBd.tff is bundled as the default font.

Running "make install" should behave correctly now.  The list of files
installed are:
$PREFIX/bin/lemonlauncher
$PREFIX/share/lemonlauncher/lemonlauncher.conf
$PREFIX/share/lemonlauncher/games.conf

The two conf files are included as examples so the user can copy/modify
them to customize lemon launcher.  By default lemon launcher will look
for these files in $HOME/.lemonlauncher but this can be modified with
the --with-confdir switch at compile time.

The only item in the ToDo list that was no implemented was screen captures.
This feature would take a screen capture of lemonlauncher so I don't really
see the point since there is not really much to see in the launcher.  One
could just as easily use the screen capture feature of their window manager.

So this should conclude the work for this release.  In the next release
I would like to add some new features:

ToDo list:
 * simple layout/skin system for re-arranging elements on the screen
 * some sort of games list generating tool which converts list the
   rom manifest created by mame into the list format of the launcher
 * the menu system needs work.  it should be extended to support multiple
   top level menus and recognize if only one level exists in which case
   a single long list of games should be used.

===========================================
This is the first working commit of the lemon launcher re-write.  It is a
work in progress which means there is probably bugs and not all features
are complete yet.

ToDo list:
 * use config file path in config.h (if set)
 * update Makefile.am files to support "make install"
 * implement screen capture feature
